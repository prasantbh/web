	<h3> Introduction </h3>
	Web Development is the process of building a source of information which can be accessed using the internet. A webpage is what the outcome of web development is called. A web page has a front-end and a back-end. Front-end is what a user sees and back-end is where the contents are added, edited and deleted as per requirement. Some of the popular languages for Web Development are HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,PHP. As an assignment, we were told to develop a website which focused on our C.V. In the page, we had to include our introduction, social media links, contact informations, skills and experiences.  

	<h3> UI Design </h3>
	UI is also known as User Interface. In simple words, UI is what a user sees in a website. UI is what attracts a user to the website so it is very necessary. 

	<h3> Experience </h3>
	This was my first time building a proper website so it was very exciting for me to do it as I always wanted to do it but never had necessary skill to do it. Being able to use different functions to work together and not being able to make it work out was hectic but I also learnt a lot from my mistakes. For sure when I make another website I will do a lot of things differently than now as I have done a lot of mistakes on this one but I feel that the best way to learn is by doing and making mistakes. Assessments like these makes students like me ready for the real world which I am sure we all will be thankful for in the future. While making the website, the most fun I had was trying to figure out the colors and design as I wanted to do a lot more than what I was capable of doing but I quickly realized that my skills were not up par to my imagination which has made me want to learn more about web development.
